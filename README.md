### Hi there, I'm Nonpawit <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

I'm currently a **freshman** at KMITL and have **competed** in a number of robotics competitions. I've experienced with 3D modelling, circuit designing, and programming (mainly C, and C++). You can contact me via Discord `whopity`.
